current mess we're in: State needs to die.
I will move every state object into their respective entities. Player is no longer a state, it needs to be an entity.

Though this creates the problem that each type of entity will need it's own list.
The solution is that entity needs to be a single type. No child classes. It has to be configureable enough to become any entity.
Another solution: Break up "state" into logical sub-chunks, but keep the same general idea (entity component)

after level load, it loads all the blocks of that level into worldmanager

collisionmanager needs to 'add to collision list' rather than eliminate.

RecycleArray = bad. make sure you have confidence in it first.
